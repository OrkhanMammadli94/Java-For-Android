6. A String object is (select all that apply)

a sequence of characters.

Correct
This describes the structure or state of a String.


similar to primitive data types in some respects.


a primitive data type.

7. Select all of the Java statements that would compile (would not cause an error).

************************************
Ans:-


String str1 = "hi";
String str2 = "HI";
out.println(str1.equals(str2));



out.println("Hello" + " programmers!");




String str1 = "hi";
String str2 = "HI";
out.println(str1 == str2);

*********************************



8. Given the following objects

String str1 = "held";
String str2;

How could you create the string herald?

********************************
Ans:- 
str2 = str1.substring(0,2);
str2 = str2 + "ra";
str2 = str2.concat(str1.substring(2,4));
